# pygame
. In this project we’ve created a Python Program, which allows the user to play this game with the computer. The player has to choose an option, either to bat or bowl and the opposite task is assigned to the computer. We’ve used 3 modules which are random, pygame and pygame function for smooth functioning and to make the game more interactive. We used the randint() function from the random module, so that the computer is able to make a random choice out of given range. We used the pygame module for window creation, changing window title and it’s logo and in processing images. We used the pygame functions for creating labels and input textboxes.
It’s simple, fun and easy to play. It consists of 2 teams who choose either bowl or bat. It is Python GUI Game where you create a virtual team of real cricket players and score points depending on how your chosen players perform in real life matches. Then the player enters the runs if he is batting and the no. of balls if he is bowling.
 The computer generates random number of runs for each ball between 1 to 6 runs. For every ball the computer gives runs and the total runs of the user is calculated once he is out. Then the target for next innings is set as 1 run more than what the user has scored.
The next innings is started and the user does batting or bowling, opposite of whatever he/she did in the first innings. Then the same loop is ran for the second innings. If the computer scores less than what user has scored, then the user wins and if he scores runs equal to the target then the user loses and it works again vice versa.
In this way the program works with the use of 3 modules. The first one is random module which helps the program as to return random number of runs resulting in increase of runs in the of the user. The same takes place for computer when it is batting. The program then compares the runs of both innings of the user and computer and it decides the winner. If the computer is able to score more runs than that of the user then the computer wins. If the computer fails to do so, then the user wins the match. 
Thus, in this way the program of our virtual cricket game works and the user can play virtually with the computer when no friend is around and also acts as a playing buddy. It is interactive, fun and simple to play and everyone can play it without any issue in a flexible way. Have Fun!
